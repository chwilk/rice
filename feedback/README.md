# Feedback from the first day

## Positive
* Introducing lots of tools in limited time
* Appreciated etherpad
* Pandas is new and appreciated
* Lots of documentation to review
* Accommodating of different backgrounds
* Good pacing
* Pandas and USGS demos were very useful

## Negative
* Pandas section not enough
* Fonts could be bigger
* Volume could be better
* First half intro material went too slowly
* Efficiency of reading materials vs summary, and inefficient demos
* Too basic/low-level
* Pace is slow, lacks energy
* Code academy not integrated with lecture component
* Time constraints preventing modules from being finished
* Didn't define bootcamp as introductory material
* Python was hard to follow because of differences for windows users
* Timing
* Multiplatform setup support could be better *Agreed, we don't have any Windows users in help*
* Too early

## Suggestions
* Upload instructions *Reiterate where instructions are*
* More examples
* Make code academy a pre-req, not a part of course
* Tie tools together better
* Do something useful with the data in the data-crunching section

## Summary:
* We had only two completely negative feedbacks (i.e. no good points)
* We had five completely positive feedbacks, one with a smiley face :-)
* The remaining fifteen feedbacks were balanced with a mix of positive and needs-improvement points.
